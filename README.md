# C Data Structures
This is a collection of data structures that I have built in C for my projects.

These are all fairly new ATM, so there are likely bugs in them that I have not run into yet.

There is also likely a test.c file or something along those lines in some of the directories,
and those are mainly just to test certain parts of the functionality of the data structures.

## Usage
Each data structure is encapsulated within their own .h file,
and to use it, just add it into the project directory or what directory you want to include it from.
Just add a ```#include ""``` statement accordingly.

THIS WILL BE CHANGED SOON
IT WILL BE PROPER LIBRARIES WITH .c FILES THAT SHOULD BE COMPILED TO .a and .o FILES
